To run a demo:
	roscore
	rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
	rosrun object_tracker turtles.py
	rosrun object_tracker secure_state_sim.py
	rosrun object_tracker map_comparator.py
	rosrun rviz

in rviz you can take a look at the compromised and uncompromised particle filters for the robot with the rviz config file. Although the code is written to support multiple robots and multiple observers it is configured to do only one.
