To run a demo, open the following in seperate terminals:
	roscore
	rosrun swarm_sim swarm_sim_node
	rosrun swarm_sim swarm.py
	rosrun object_tracker map_comparator.py
	rosrun rviz 

in rviz you can take a look at the compromised and uncompromised particle filters for the robot with the rviz config file. Although the code is written to support multiple robots and multiple observers it is configured to do only one.

Once all that is complete, open a new terminal and type:
"rosservice call /betray 'turtle2'"
